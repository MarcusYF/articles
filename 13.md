As some people in poor countries are vastly underweight as a result of poverty, others elsewhere in the world are suffering from another problem -- obesity, as a consequence of improved living conditions. A recent study has shown the latter problem is becoming an epidemic, as the number of obese population keeps growing alarmingly. I believe there are several factors responsible for this increase.

The first reason is the unhealthy diet. Nowadays people face fierce compitition and suffer from great pressure and they have to devote more time and energy to their work. Consequently fast food has been gaining in popularity at an amazing rate. Although fast food is time-saving, it lacks nutritive value. Medical research reveals that eating too much fast food will result in excessive intake of calories, salt and sugar, which leads to being overweight.

Obesity is not only a question of what people eat, but also a matter of lifestyles. Television and the Internet have produced sedentary lifestyles. People who watch TV passively or use computers for hours every day simply do not get enough physical exercise. Besides, an increasing number of people have come to rely on private cars, rather than walking or using bicycles. Lack of activity eventually contributes to obesity.

In view of the seriousness of this problem, effective measures must be taken before things get worse. In the first place, a proper diet consisting of more vegetables and fruit and fewer fatty foods may assist. In the second place, it is of great importance that people participate in various kinds of sports including jogging, swimming, and cycling.
