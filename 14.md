Choosing the right career is regarded as a turning point in one's life. It is so crucial that we cannot afford to make a single mistake. However, it is always not so easy to make a satisfying choice. Sometimes we find ourselves involved in dilemmas. To my mind, when we seek a job,the following factors need to be taken into consideration.

The first factor that can be seen by every person is that a salary should not be too low. Most people will be married and have children, so they need a stable income because of their family responsibilities even if they are not satisfied with their job. In addition, to live a more comfortable life is a part of human nature. All these things need a certain amount of money.

Another factor that we must consider is that we should have an objective understanding of our ability so that we will know which occupations are suitable for us. In other words, the job should allow us to live a balanced life. It should not be so time-consuming that we have no time for family, friends and personal interests. Nor should it give us so much pressure that we cannot relax in our free time. 

As the proverb goes, two heads are better than one. When we choose a job, always remember to talk with parents, teachers or anyone we trust. They possess rich experience from which we are sure to benefit. They know us best and can offer us the most sincere advice. Keep in mind the old saying that it is good to learn at another man's cost. Furthermore, we may also seek advice from a career advisory office which is always ready to provide professional suggestions.
