People usually think that a suitable job may become a turning point of one's life. Seeking jobs is so important that no one can afford a single mistake. However, choosing a proper job is not easy. Sometimes we may find ourselves involved in dilemmas. I believe the following aspects should as least be considered when we seek a job.

The first factor that almost everyone may consider is a high salary. Since most people end up in marriage, they need to maintain a stable income to support families even though they may be not satisfied with their jobs. Besides, the pursuit of cozy lives is human nature. All of these cannot be guaranteed without a certain amount of money.

Another factor that has to be considered is an objective awareness of one's capabilities, by which we may find out what kind of jobs is suitable for us. That is to say, this job should allow us maintain a balance between life and work. We cannot work overtime frequently and thus have no time to spend with friends and families or foster personal interests. The work pressure should not be excessively heavy or we cannot really relax. 

As the proverb goes, two heads are better than one. When we choose our job, we should communicate with our parents, teachers or somebody else we trust. We are likely to get benefits from their rich experience. They know us a lot and are able to offer sincere advices. Always remember: learning from others' lessons always help. In addition, we may reach to career consultants for professional suggestions.
